=========================
Laursen's thesis template
=========================

This is an alternative to the "LUKE'S PHD THESIS TEMPLATE 1.2" used as standard layout for the
thesis written at DTU Compute.

The template is using the `Memoir class <http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/>`_
which includes a lot of useful and predefined commands.

An updated version of the code can be downloaded from the
`repository at bitbucket.org <https://bitbucket.org/_laursen/laursens-xelatex-thesis-template/>`_.
